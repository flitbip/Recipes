# RECIPE BOOK

A super minimal recipe website. 

Create a new recipe as a [Markdown file](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), dump it in a folder and upload. The list will auto-populate and each recipe is displayed in a nice, clean format designed for use while cooking or at the grocery store. Great for keeping track of family recipes, mods to ones you find online, or have created yourself!

## BONUS!  
To save your place while looking up at the ingredients, click the step you're on to highlight it. Click it again to remove the highlight, or use the left/right arrow keys to advance.

## RECIPE FORMAT  
In order to show up properly, your recipe's Markdown file should be named with dashes in place of spaces (ex: `rice-pilaf.md` or `saag-paneer.md`) and the file should follow this format:
