## ingredients
* 2 lbs pork belly cut with skin attached into 2"x1" strips
* 1 onion
* 6 cloves garlic
* 3-4 potatoes
* 1/4 cup Soy Sauce

* 1 tsp sugar
*1/2 tsp pepper
*5-6 bay leaves

## steps  
1. Marinade pork overnight with smashed garlic, soy sauce and vinegar mix.  
2. Fry pork skin down until brown then cook covered until pork is cooked. Don't let the sauce cook down, the sauce is thickened by the pork fat rendering.
3. Serve with rice.

## notes
This recipe relies on a piece of pork belly with skin and fat attached. There should be a 80/20 ratio of meat/fat so that the sauce glazes the meat.
