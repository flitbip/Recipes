# Soft Dinner Rolls

## info  
* Prep: 60min Proof: 45min  Cooking: 25min 
* 3 dozen 2oz rolls 

## ingredients
* Bread Flour (All Purpose is ok) 2 lbs. 10 oz
* Water (60-65°F [16-18oC]) 1 lb. 8 oz (3 cups)
* Yeast Instant (quick-rise) 1⁄2oz
* Salt. 1 tbsp. + 1 tsp.
* Sugar 4 oz
* Nonfat Milk Solids 2 oz
* Butter, softened 4 oz

##steps
1. Add instant yeast to water, whisk, and set aside.
2. Combine all dry ingredients in the bowl of an electric stand mixer
fitted with the dough hook attachment. Set aside softened butter.
3. While on low speed, pour the water/yeast mixture into the dry mixture
within 10 seconds. Continue mixing on low speed for 4 minutes.
4. Stop the mixer and add the softened butter. Mix on low speed to
combine. Dough will loosen and become sticky.
5. Mix on medium speed for about 4 minutes, or until the dough tightens
up again and become elastic.
6. Transfer to bowl sprayed with cooking spray and ferment at room
temperature for about 45 minutes, or until doubled bulk. (*see note)
7. After done fermenting, turn dough onto work surface and scale into 2
oz. portions (about 36 portions). Round rolls and arrange on parchment-lined sheet pan. Lightly spray tops of rolls with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Proof rolls for about 30-45 minutes at room temperature to reach full proof.
8. For increased browning, gently brush with milk or egg wash (optional) before placing in oven.
9. Bake in a 365°F (185oC) oven for about 25 minutes (internal temperature of about 200oF (93oC), or until golden brown.
10.Cool rolls. If not serving immediately, wrap in plastic and store in the freezer.
