# Bagels

## info  
* 12–24 hours proof, then about 45 minutes  
* 8 small-ish bagels  

## ingredients
* 14.66 oz bread flour (APF ok but not as good)  
* 4 tsp vital wheat gluten (optional, sub with more flour)  
* 2 tsp instant yeast  
* 9 oz cold water  
* 2 tbsp malt syrup  
* 2 tsp salt  
* Cornmeal  
* 1/4 cup sugar  
* 1 tbsp baking soda  
* Olive oil  

## steps  
1. In a food processor, combine flour, wheat gluten, and yeast; pulse to combine  
2. Add water and malt syrup, mix for 20 seconds  
3. Let dough sit for 10 minutes  
4. Add salt, run food processor for 90 seconds  
5. Remove dough and knead for about a minute  
6. Divide into eight balls (for small-ish bagels) or 6 (for big ones)  
7. Roll into balls, cover, and let sit for 15 minutes  
8. Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil, then thoroughly dust with cornmeal  
9. Place dough ball on work surface; poke hole with finger, then work into an even, bagel-like shape (hole should be slightly larger than you think it should be) and place on baking sheet  
10. Cover and let sit for an hour, then transfer to fridge for 12–24 hours  
11. Preheat oven to 450ºF (or slightly lower, depending on your oven)  
12. Prepare a wire rack that fits your baking sheet; lightly grease with olive oil  
13. In a pot, add water, sugar, and baking soda; bring to a rolling boil  
14. One at a time, drop the bagel into the water (cornmeal side up) and cook for 30 seconds; flip and cook for another 30 seconds  
15. Remove and place on wire rack; immediately add any toppings you want to use  
16. Add 1/2-cup boiling water to the baking sheet  
17. Bake for 20–25 minutes until deeply golden brown, flipping halfway through  
18. Let rest for at least 15 minutes before eating  

## notes  
* Try adding paneer instead of or alongside the potatoes (making it either Matar Paneer or Aloo Matar Paneer), same cooking time applies
