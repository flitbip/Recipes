# Turkish "Katmer" Layered Flat Bread 

## info  
* Turkish Katmer is a famous flatbread made in stovetop in a pan or griddle. It is a rich bread with butter and has no yeast. 
* 12 small size katmer bread  

## ingredients
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 to 2+1/4 cup flour

For the butter layers:
* 2 heaped tbsp butter (60 gr)
* 4 tbsp olive oil (in total I used 75 gr. butter-oil mixture)
* 1 heaped tbsp flour

## steps  
1. Melt butter with oil and make a roux with the flour.
2. Mix water, salt and 2 cups flour.
3. Add flour as needed until mixed with dough hook sticks slightly in the bottom of the bowl.
4. Cut dough in half, cover one in film while rolling the other out into a thin sheet (as rectangular as possible)
5. Spread butter/oil mixture to the edges of the sheet and roll up the dough tightly. Repeat with the other piece.
6. Place on a floured plate, cover with film and put in the refrigerator for at least two hours until butter is chilled.
7. Cut each into 6 even pieces, shape the ends of each tube to close so that butter doesn't come out. 
8. Start heating cast-iron skillet on low-medium heat.
9. Then squash end-on into a patty and roll flat. Flour between each and cover on a plate with thin film.
10. Cook one at a time on the hot skillet adjusting heat so that they puff as the steam from the butter escapes.

## notes  
* Also try to add some tahini with the butter mixture.
